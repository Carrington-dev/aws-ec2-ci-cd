## Security Best Practices

To keep your Django application secure, follow these best practices:

### 1. Keep Dependencies Updated

- Regularly update Django and third-party libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade django
  pip list --outdated
  ```
- Use [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) to check for vulnerable dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pip-audit
  pip-audit
  ```

### 2. Use Environment Variables for Secrets

- Never store sensitive data (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, database passwords) in source code.
- Use environment variables and `django-environ` for configuration:
  ```python
  import environ
  env = environ.Env()
  SECRET_KEY = env('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
  ```

### 3. Enable Security Middleware

Ensure these security middleware settings are enabled in `settings.py`:

```python
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
```

### 4. Use Strong Authentication & Authorization

- Enforce strong passwords with Django‚Äôs built-in validators:
  ```python
  AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
      {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator'},
      {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator'},
      {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator'},
  ]
  ```
- Use Django's built-in authentication features like `django.contrib.auth` and [Django REST Framework JWT Authentication](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### 5. Perform Regular Security Audits

- Run Django security checks:
  ```bash
  python manage.py check --deploy
  ```
- Use `bandit` for static security analysis:
  ```bash
  pip install bandit
  bandit -r .
  ```
- Use automated tools like OWASP ZAP for penetration testing.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We encourage security researchers to test our application in accordance with ethical hacking guidelines. Please adhere to the following:

- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond necessary testing.
- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before an official patch is released.
- Do not test on live production data; use test environments instead.
